## A Comparative Evaluation of Deep Learning Approaches to Online Network Traffic Classification for Community Networks

### 1) Preprocessing

1. Use *pkt2flow* to split raw PCAP files into flows
2. Label the packets in each flow by running *nDPI* on each flow
3. Create `train.csv` and `test.csv` files containing packet-label pairs.

### 2) Deep Learning Models

To be done later.
